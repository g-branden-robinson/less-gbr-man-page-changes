.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B lessecho
is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output.
But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an "escape"
character, which by default is a backslash.
.B lessecho
is invoked internally by
.BR less ,
and is not intended to be used directly by humans.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-e\fIx\fP
Specifies "\fIx\fP", rather than backslash, to be the escape char for metachars.
If \fIx\fP is "\-", no escape char is used and arguments containing metachars
are surrounded by quotes instead.
.TP
.B \-o\fIx\fP
Specifies "\fIx\fP", rather than double-quote, to be the open quote character,
which is used if the \-e\- option is specified.
.TP
.B \-c\fIx\fP
Specifies "\fIx\fP" to be the close quote character.
.TP
.B \-p\fIn\fP
Specifies "\fIn\fP" to be the open quote character, as an integer.
.TP
.B \-d\fIn\fP
Specifies "\fIn\fP" to be the close quote character, as an integer.
.TP
.B \-m\fIx\fP
Specifies "\fIx\fP" to be a metachar.
By default, no characters are considered metachars.
.TP
.B \-n\fIn\fP
Specifies "\fIn\fP" to be a metachar, as an integer.
.TP
.B \-f\fIn\fP
Specifies "\fIn\fP" to be the escape char for metachars, as an integer.
.TP
.B \-a
Specifies that all arguments are to be quoted.
The default is that only arguments containing metacharacters are quoted.
